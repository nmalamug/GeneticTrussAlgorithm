# Genetic Truss Optimizer
## 1. Welcome!
Welcome to the genetic truss optimizer. This is a MATLAB application that automatically generates an optimized truss based on initial conditions that you specify, such as pin, roller, and load placement. 
## 2. How To Use

## 3. Analysis

### 3.1 How It Works

### 3.2 Initial Goals

### 3.3 Results

## 4. ToDo
- Create speed optimizations for truss generation.
- Reuse more of the truss in generational steps.
- Decrease model tendency to get stuck in local maxima. 
- Improve the FrontEnd UI/UX of the app.
