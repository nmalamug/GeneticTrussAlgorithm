# Genetic Truss Optimizer
## 1. Welcome!
Welcome to the Genetic Truss Optimizer. This is a MATLAB application that automatically generates an optimized truss based on initial conditions that you specify, such as pin, roller, and load placement. 
## 2. How To

### 2.1. Enter Initial Conditions

### 2.2 Run the Algorithm

### 2.3 View Truss at Rank

### 2.4 Export a Truss

## 3. Analysis

### 3.1 How It Works

### 3.2 Initial Goals

### 3.3 Results

## 4. ToDo
Although I've posted the project, I still feel it has a lot of untapped potential. When I come back to this project I will:
- Create speed optimizations for truss generation.
- Reuse more of the truss in generational steps.
- Decrease model tendency to get stuck in local maxima. 
- Improve app usability.
- Parallellize some processes.
Notes: The model does really bad with deleting points and inserting points where a member is too long. I have ideas on how to approach these.
